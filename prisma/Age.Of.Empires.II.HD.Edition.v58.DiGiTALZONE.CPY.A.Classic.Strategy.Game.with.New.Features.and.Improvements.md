Age of Empires II HD is not only a game of conquest and expansion, but also a game of strategy and tactics. To succeed in the game, you need to master the basics of economy, military, and technology. Here are some tips to help you improve your gameplay:

- Choose a civilization that suits your playstyle and map. Each civilization has unique bonuses, units, and technologies that can give you an edge over your opponents. For example, the Mongols have faster cavalry and stronger siege weapons, which are ideal for open maps and aggressive raids. The Byzantines have cheaper defensive buildings and stronger monks, which are useful for closed maps and defensive play.
- Manage your resources wisely. You need food, wood, gold, and stone to build your empire and army. You should always have enough villagers working on each resource to keep a steady income. You should also balance your spending and saving depending on your situation. For example, if you want to advance to the next age quickly, you should save up enough resources for the upgrade. If you want to attack or defend against an enemy, you should spend your resources on units and buildings.
- Scout the map and your enemies. You should always explore the map as much as possible to find valuable resources, relics, and strategic locations. You should also keep an eye on your enemies' movements and actions to anticipate their plans and counter them. For example, if you see your enemy building a lot of archers, you should prepare some skirmishers or knights to counter them.
- Use the right units and formations for each situation. You should always try to use units that have an advantage over your enemies' units. For example, pikemen are effective against cavalry, cavalry are effective against archers, and archers are effective against infantry. You should also use different formations to optimize your units' performance. For example, you can use the box formation to protect your ranged units from melee attacks, or the staggered formation to avoid splash damage from siege weapons.
- Research technologies that benefit your strategy and civilization. You should always try to research technologies that improve your economy, military, or technology. For example, you can research wheelbarrow or hand cart to increase your villagers' efficiency, or fletching or bodkin arrow to increase your archers' range and damage. You should also research technologies that are unique to your civilization or unlock special units or abilities. For example, you can research stirrups for the Bulgarians to increase your cavalry's attack speed, or faith for the Teutons to make your units more resistant to conversion.

These are some of the basic tips that can help you improve your gameplay in Age of Empires II HD. However, there is much more to learn and discover in this complex and rewarding game. You can find more guides and tutorials online[^1^], or watch some of the best players in action on YouTube or Twitch. You can also practice with different settings and scenarios in single-player or multiplayer mode. The most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the game!
