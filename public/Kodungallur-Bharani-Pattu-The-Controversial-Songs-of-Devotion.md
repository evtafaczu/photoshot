The Meena Bharani festival is celebrated in March or April every year and attracts thousands of devotees, especially oracles who dress up in red costumes and carry swords. They enter a trance-like state and dance to the rhythm of drums and cymbals. They also sing the Kodungallur Bharani Pattu, which are composed of verses that are vulgar, obscene and violent. The songs are meant to please the goddess, who is said to be fond of such expressions of devotion. The songs also ridicule her enemies, such as Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva, Lord Brahma and other Hindu gods and goddesses.
 
The Kodungallur Bharani Pattu has been a subject of controversy for many years, as some people consider them to be offensive and disrespectful to Hinduism. Some people have also tried to ban or censor them, claiming that they hurt the religious sentiments of others. However, the devotees and the temple authorities have defended the songs as a part of their tradition and culture. They argue that the songs are not meant to be taken literally, but rather symbolically. They also claim that the songs are a way of expressing their love and loyalty to the goddess, who is seen as a mother figure.
 
The Kodungallur Bharani Pattu is a unique example of how folk songs can reflect the history, culture and beliefs of a community. They also show how different forms of devotion can coexist in Hinduism, which is known for its diversity and tolerance. The songs are a testimony to the power and glory of Goddess Bhadrakali, who is worshipped as the supreme deity in Kodungallur.
  
## History of Kodungallur Bharani Pattu
 
The history of Kodungallur Bharani Pattu is closely linked to the history of Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple, which is one of the oldest temples in Kerala. The temple is said to have been built by Parasurama, the legendary sage who reclaimed Kerala from the sea. The temple was also the capital of the Chera dynasty, which ruled over Kerala and Tamil Nadu from ancient times. The temple was a center of learning, culture and trade, and attracted many scholars, poets and merchants from different parts of India and abroad.
 
The Kodungallur Bharani Pattu is believed to have originated from the ancient tantric rituals that were practiced at the temple. These rituals involved the worship of Goddess Bhadrakali as the supreme power, who was also associated with fertility, sexuality and death. The rituals also involved the sacrifice of animals, especially roosters, which were considered to be symbols of male potency. The blood of the roosters was offered to the goddess as a sign of devotion and gratitude. The devotees also engaged in sexual intercourse with each other or with the temple prostitutes, who were considered to be representatives of the goddess. The devotees also consumed intoxicating substances such as alcohol and cannabis, which helped them to enter a trance-like state and experience ecstasy.
 
The Kodungallur Bharani Pattu was sung by the devotees as a part of these rituals. The songs were composed of verses that were crude, abusive and erotic. The songs praised the goddess for her beauty, power and grace, and also mocked her enemies for their weakness, cowardice and impotence. The songs also expressed the devotees' love, loyalty and surrender to the goddess, who was seen as their mother, lover and protector. The songs also reflected the social and political realities of the times, such as the conflicts between different kingdoms, castes and religions.
 
The Kodungallur Bharani Pattu has survived through centuries of changes and challenges. The songs have been passed down orally from generation to generation by the devotees, especially by the oracles who are considered to be possessed by the goddess. The songs have also been influenced by various literary and cultural movements, such as Tamil Sangam literature, Bhakti movement, Malayalam poetry and folk music. The songs have also been adapted to suit different contexts and audiences, such as festivals, weddings, funerals and protests.
